title: "Understanding reported carbon dioxide emissions based on plant-level iron and steel industry details"

---
The **carbon dioxide emission data** from the Green House Gases Reporting Program of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are compared with the plant process information reported by the Association for Iron and Steel Technology (AIST); data reliability and correlations are analyzed with regression analysis, which provides a better understanding of the CO2 emissions of Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) steelmaking.
